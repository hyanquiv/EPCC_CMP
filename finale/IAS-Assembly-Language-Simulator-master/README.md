# Program #10

## Name:
Chris Schultz

## What, if anything, is not working?
The program here is working as intended! It does not check if an instruction is valid before reading it into memory but it will prevent it from executing. Program was tested on both the included .txt files, as well as Homework Assignments 1, 3 and 4.

This IAS simulator is now capable of storing and loading data and performing any math operations.
